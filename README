ndsfs Nintendo DS ROM file system mounter (v1.1)
 by Andrew Brampton (bramp.net)
 using knowledge/code from ndstool by Rafael Vuijk (aka DarkFader)

INTRO

  Using FUSE[1], a Nintendo DS ROM can be mounted as a file system. This tool is
  similar to ndstool[2], but allows you to browse the rom without extracting.

COMPILE

  make

RUN

  ndsfs <rom file> <mount point>

TODO
  Add extra checks to see if file_ids are valid
  Implement cache so common paths aren't checked so often
  Make sure this code works on big endian machines
  Add write support (hard)
  The mount directory looks really wierd unless you are a superuser
  We have coarse grain locking, change this to be more fine grain.
